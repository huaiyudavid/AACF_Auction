	<h6>Hello, and welcome to the AACF Auction 2016!!! We hope this will be a fun and effective way to fundraise for our fellowship so that our fellowship can be better equipped to "know Christ and share his love," whether that looks like having more outreach events, giving more scholarships to people going on retreats, buying Bibles, etc. So go ahead, add some goods/services you can sell, bid on things you're interested in buying, and comment when you have something to share. Bidding will end on 4/10 and fulfillments will begin afterwards. Happy bidding!</h6>
